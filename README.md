## Project Description:
Integration of NFDI4Microbiota Researchers into Wikidata

As part of this project, we were provided with an Excel spreadsheet containing a list of researchers and their respective research institutions in the context of NFDI4Microbiota. The aim of the project is to systematically import these datasets into Wikidata.

The names of the researchers are initially cross-referenced with existing sources such as ORCID, Scholia, or the websites of the participating projects (e.g., NFDI4Microbiota, base4NFDI). This process checks whether a Wikidata entry already exists for each individual. Existing entries are disregarded in this project; the focus is solely on identifying and creating new entries.

For each new individual, their ORCID iD is retrieved from the ORCID directory, if available, and linked to the corresponding Wikidata entry. The ORCID iD is stored in Wikidata as a distinct identifier with the appropriate source citation.

Already existing entities that can be associated with the person—such as research institutions or project involvements—are linked to the new person entry as so-called “sub-objects.” The entry begins with basic information (name, institution, identifiers) and is supplemented with additional details if the project duration permits.
